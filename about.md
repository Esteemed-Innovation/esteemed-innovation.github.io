This is the development/developers blog and API documentation site for the Esteemed Innovation Team. Monthly, the developers of Esteemed Innovation will provide a community update on the progress of the mod and any upcoming decisions that will need to be made.

This blog is intended to suit two purposes. First, to provide the community with knowledge on the progress of the mod (*i.e.*, so we can point to the blog when asked if the mod is alive or for an ETA). Second, it is to provide the community with knowledge of yet-to-be-made or loose decisions that are being made/discussed so that they can provide input and help direct the mod in a direction they might like to see. This second point is important, as the EI Team operates on a collectivist basis.

This site does not provide information on *using* the mod in game. For that, please see the wiki.
